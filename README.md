Infinario Android SDK is available in this Git repository:Â <a href="https://github.com/infinario/unity-sdk">https://github.com/infinario/unity-sdk</a>.

## Installation

Sources are readily aviable, as well as an exported unitypackage in the root of this repository.

## Usage

### Basic Interface

To start tracking, you need to know your ```project_token``` and generate a unique ```customer_id``` for the customer you are about to track. The unique ```customer_id``` can either be string, or an object representing the ```customer_ids``` as referenced in [the API guide](http://guides.infinario.com/technical-guide/rest-client-api/#Detailed_key_descriptions).
Setting ```customer_id = "123-asdf"``` is equivalent to ```customer_id = new Dictionary<String, String> () {{"registered","123-adf"}};```


```
var infinario = new Infinario.Infinario(project_token);
```

If this is the beginning of tracking of a new user, you need to first ```Identify``` him against the server.

All of the commands spawn a coroutine, so that they won't block the processing in your main application.

```
//this will set the attribute 'registered' to customer_id
infinario.Identify(customer_id);
```

Identifying anonymous user with a cookie.

```
//this will set the attribute 'cookie' for anonymous player
infinario.Identify(new Dictionary<string, string>(){ {"registered", customer_id}});
```

Identifying user with a cookie with new registered id.

```
//this will set the attribute 'registered' for player with attribute 'cookie' cookie-of-anonymous-player
infinario.Identify(new Dictionary<string, string>(){ {"registered", customer_id}, {"cookie", cookie-of-anonymous-player } });
```

For serialization we utilize small embedded MiniJSON parser. 

You track various events by utilizing the Track function.
It assumes you want to track the customer you identified by ```Identify```.
The only required field is a string describing the type of your event.
By default the time of the event is tracked as the epoch time,
and diffed against the server time of Infinario before sending.

```
infinario.Track("login");
```

Tracking event with attributes:

```
infinario.Track("quest", new Dictionary<string, string> () {{"status","completed"}, {"name","Defend castle"}});
```

Update currently identified customer:

```
infinario.Update(new Dictionary<string, string> () {{"first_name","John"}, {"last_name","Wick"}});
```
